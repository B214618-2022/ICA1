Welcome to this very barebones readme.

To use this program, first run the analysistool.sh script. This assumes that the files are located in /localhost/data... If they are somewhere else, you will have to change the location in the script.

the awk script is not to be run by itself, it is referenced in the groupcalc.sh cript

the groupcalc.sh script performs post analysis calcualtions on the data for groupwise analysis.
